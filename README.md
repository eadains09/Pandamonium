# Pandamonium: Pounce's Maze Adventure

I developed this game over a summer at <a href = https://www.makeschool.com/>Make School Bootcamp</a>. Before starting work on Pandamonium, I did not know Objective-C and had been programming for only two years. This was an amazing learning experience, and I'm very proud of the game I developed.

Help Pounce the Red Panda find fruit to eat in the maze, collecting power ups to freeze time, explode walls and teleport along the way!

You can download Pandamonium for free from the iOS app store at http://goo.gl/mgl4vc and check out my website at www.erikadains.com!
