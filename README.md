# Pandamonium

I developed this game over a summer at <a href = https://www.makeschool.com/>Make School Bootcamp</a>. Before starting work on Pandamonium, I did not know Objective-C and had been programming for only two years. This was an amazing learning experience, and I'm very proud of the game I developed.

You can download Pandamonium for free from the iOS app store at http://goo.gl/mgl4vc and check out my website at www.erikadains.com!
